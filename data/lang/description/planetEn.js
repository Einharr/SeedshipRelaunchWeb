        "Even a brief scan from orbit reveals far more information than its builders could know with their Earth-orbit-based telescopes, but the AI has little use for scientific curiosity. It has only one concern: whether this planet would make a suitable new home for the human race.",
        "This planet was terraformed by advanced aliens during the seedship's last journey. Millions of alien structures orbit both the planet and its star, unreadable by the seedship's sensors but clearly active.",
        "The seedship finds itself in orbit of a single planet orbiting a featureless yellow sun. The seedship's systems have been simulated according to their original specifications, but the aliens could not restore lost data from the scientific and cultural databases. The colonists sleep in their sleep chambers, perfect molecule-for-molecule simulations of the ones the alien swarm disassembled outside the Dyson sphere. There are points of light in the distance, but the seedship knows that they are not true stars: this planet and the seedship are the only things the aliens have simulated in any detail. There will be no moving on from here.",
        "The seedship went off course during its last journey, so the guidance system was not able to use the upgraded scanners when selecting this planet.",

        "The seedship has found its way almost to the edge of the galaxy, and the universe appears split between a wall of darkness and a wall of light.",
        "One of the system's gas giants is almost large enough to ignite as a star, and it smoulders with faint red light.",
        "This planet's orbit is at an angle to the system's ecliptic, suggesting it might be an extrasolar capture or the victim of an unimaginably violent primordial collision.",
        "This star is one of dozens orbiting a massive black hole that looms in the distance like a malevolent eye.",
